    "data_download": "I want you to act as a data scientist, and write a Python function that downloads the Movielens 100k data and return the pandas dataframe as the output of the function. The pandas dataframe should maintain the original header of the movielens dataset.",
    "data_split": "I want you to act as a machine learning engineering, and develop a Python-based function that randomly splits the dataframe rows with a split ratio which is the input parameter to the function. The returned value should be a tuple of the splits of the dataframe.",
    "train_model": "I want you to act as a data scientist to develop a function that trains a collaborative filtering based recommender model. The function uses the training data set that is generated from the above function. The algorithm used in the recommender should be the SAR algorithm that is available in the Microsoft Recommenders library.",
    "evaluate_model": "I want you to act as a data scientist. You should develop a Python function that uses a trained model that is generated from the above function to evaluate the performance of the recommender model on a given testing data set.",
    "pipeline": "I want you to act as a machine learning engineer, and write a function that runs the entire workflow starting from data download, data split, model building, and model evaluating. And the final output of the pipeline shall be the model object if the precision is smaller than 0, otherwise raise exception.",
    "reformat": "I want you to act as a machine learning engineer, and add the docstring to each of the functions in the above python script to enhance the readability. The docstring should use the Google style format.",
    "unit_test": "I want you to act as a machine learning engineering. You should write the unit tests for the above functions by using the pytest framework in Python. The unit tests should have a code coverage which is at least 60%.",
    "requirements": "I want to you act as a data scientist, and develop a requirements.txt that captures all the Python libraries used in the project. The Python libraries should have the latest stable version that have no mutual conflicts with each other.",
    "setup": "I want you to act as a machine learning engineer, and develop a 'how-to' markdown file that summarises the system set up, installation of python libraries, set up of conda virtual environment, etc., which can be used for getting started with the project."
