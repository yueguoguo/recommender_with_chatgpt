# Collaborative Filtering with ChatGPT

## Introduction

This repository demonstrates how to build a simple collaborative filtering
recommender system in Python with ChatGPT. 

The codes in the repository are generated from GPT-4 which is available on
ChatGPT-plus [here](https://chat.openai.com/). OpenAI also exposes APIs to use
ChatGPT - this repository does not use the programmatic approach to generate
codes with prompts. 

## How-to

The detailed instructions can be found in [this document](src/README.md).
